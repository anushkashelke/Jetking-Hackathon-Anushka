Created an NFT and Token

Description about NFT

Some people might not understand what exactly is a cryptocurrency, the value of one bitcoin or how is it different from other crypto coins, etc.
So I have created an NFT which is an image that depicts the value/demand of crypto tokens through a real-life example.
Consider a bank named “Crypto Bank”. This bank has appointed Bitcoin as CEO due to its capabilities and thus earns a maximum salary among all other employees. Ethereum on the other hand is COO which is also at high post but has less importance than CEO. If Ethereum tries its best it can surely beat Bitcoin soon! Similarly, other crypto coins are working for the bank at different positions.
Now coming to the digital world, the CEO position which is of highest priority denotes the price and market value, which is surely the highest for Bitcoin today. Other higher positions like CCO, Manager, etc thus follow bitcoin respectively in terms of price and market value.
Thus a person who has more bitcoins is not less than a CEO!
